"""
State method is Behavioral Design Pattern that allows an object
to change its behavior when there occurs a change in its internal
state. It helps in implementing the state as a derived class of
the state pattern interface. If we have to change the behavior of
an object based on its state, we can have a state variable in the
Object and use if-else condition block to perform different actions
based on the state. It may be termed as the object-oriented state
machine. It implements the state transitions by invoking methods
from the patternâ€™s superclass.
