# The observer method is a Behavioral design Pattern which allows
# you to define or create a subscription mechanism to send the
# notification to the multiple objects about any new event that
# happens to the object that they are observing. The subject is
# basically observed by multiple objects. The subject needs to be
# monitored and whenever there is a change in the subject, the
# observers are being notified about the change. This pattern
# defines one to Many dependencies between objects so that one
# object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and
# updated automatically.
