"""
Adapter method helps us in making the incompatible objects adaptable to each other.
The Adapter method is one of the easiest methods to understand because we have a lot
of real-life examples that show the analogy with it. The main purpose of this method
is to create a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This method provides a
different interface for a class. We can more easily understand the concept by thinking
about the Cable Adapter that allows us to charge a phone somewhere that has outlets in
different shapes. Using this idea, we can integrate the classes that couldnâ€™t be
integrated due to interface incompatibility.
